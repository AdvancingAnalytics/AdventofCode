# Advent of Code 2021

This repo contains the [Advancing Analytics](https://www.advancinganalytics.co.uk/) team's contributions to Advent of Code 2021.

We split into three teams to tackle each day's challenges using different technologies, languages, and methods. This helps us learn from each other and we hope others in the data community can benefit from these solutions and approaches

Check out our solutions and get in touch if you have any questions!
